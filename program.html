                     <br> <strong> Fetal Assessment Using MRI: Beyond Volumetric Evaluation</strong> <br>
                     Pregnancy is a window into the future health of both mothers and their offspring. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated superior accuracy and sensitivity compared to ultrasound, thus enhancing fetal assessment. MRI provides 3D multi-contrast information, enabling accurate volumetric measurements of fetal organs and placenta. However, additional functional and metabolic information, which indirectly reflects microstructural tissue properties, can be obtained, yet it is often underused. Advances in computational power and AI models have significantly advanced the quantitative assessment of fetal development. However, volumetric assessment represents only the tip of the iceberg, with a wealth of essential information accessible through advanced MRI methods. The talk will provide an overview of recent advancements and trends in AI aimed at enhancing fetal image acquisition and extracting quantitative measurements. Additionally, it will delve into the utilization of advanced MRI techniques to go beyond volumetric structural data. <br><br><br><br>

She obtained her Ph.D. in chemical physics from Tel Aviv University before assuming the role of Deputy Director of the Sagol Brain Institute and head of MRI systems at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (TASMC).
                                  <br>With extensive training and a comprehensive background in MR physics, Professor Ben Bashat has specialized in the development of advanced MR acquisition and analysis methods. Her primary research objectives focus on enhancing patients' diagnosis and prognosis by leveraging state-of-the-art methods to develop more precise diagnostic tools. Over the past two decades, her research has centered primarily on brain pathologies, brain development, and fetal and placental assessment. Several of these methods have been successfully implemented in clinical practice at TASMC.

D. degree in pharmaceutical sciences (biophysics) from The University of Tokyo in 1994. He was a JSPS postdoctoral fellow at Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University and Neuro-Muscular Research Center, Boston University in 1994. He joined the complex system research group as an assistant professor at Department of Pure and Applied sciences, University of Tokyo in 1995. In 2000, he established Developmental Brain Science Laboratory at Graduate School of Education.
               <br>Prof. Taga has been studying the human early development as a complex dynamical system, and has conducted research aiming at elucidating the mechanisms of brain morphogenesis, emergence of spontaneous activity, network formation, functional region differentiation, behavioral and cognitive development in a changing environment. He is known by the dynamical systems modeling study of the neuro-musculo-skeletal system for human locomotion. He is also known as a pioneer of brain imaging of infants by using fNIRS. His group has established a novel fNIRS analysis framework to reveal spontaneous activity, functional activity, functional connectivity, oxygenation and hemodynamics of the developing brain. His laboratory has also conducted behavioral studies to elucidate the developmental mechanisms for motion, perception, sleep and language.

                              <br> Bob Lathrop is a research scientist working with the Robot-Assisted Surgery group at Katholieke University Leuven and the Fetal Medicine unit of University Hospital Leuven, Belgium. His research is focused on the design and development of specialized instruments and systems for fetal therapy, especially for fetal endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) procedures to treat fetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). He has developed a flexible robot-actuated fetoscope to simplify and reduce tissue damage in FETO procedures. Prior to joining KU Leuven he worked as a research engineer with Smith & Nephew, designing electrosurgical devices for minimally invasive surgeries. His ongoing work also includes the development of a tele-operated system for the control of fetoscope and ultrasound probe position, which will be used to investigate synergistic and autonomous robotic control strategies for fetal surgery.<br><br></b><br><br>

                              <br>Dr Gareth Ball’s research sits at the interface of paediatrics, neuroscience and machine learning. His work focuses on the development of analysis methods with application to large imaging datasets to understand the impact of early adverse events, including preterm birth, on typical brain development. Dr Ball was awarded his PhD from Imperial College London in 2012 and received an MRC Special Training Fellowship in Bioinformatics to conduct postdoctoral training in the Centre for the Developing Brain, King’s College London. Dr Ball joined the Developmental Imaging group at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia in 2016. As Senior Research Fellow and Team Leader at MCRI, he was recently awarded a 5-year Emerging Leader Fellowship from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council to support his research program.<br><br></b><br><br>

                             <br>Dr. Maria Deprez is a Senior Lecturer at King's College London. She leads research on motion correction and image analysis of fetal and neonatal MRI to enable diagnosis and biomarker extraction. Her techniques are underpinning numerous fetal research projects and fetal MRI clinical services at St Thomas’ and Evelina Children Hospital London.  Dr Deprez has over 15 years of experience in advanced image analysis with focus on MRI during fetal, neonatal and early childhood periods. She completed her PhD in Medical Image Computing at Imperial College London in 2009. She worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College London, University of Oxford and King’s College London, before taking up an academic position at King’s. <br><br></b><br><br>
