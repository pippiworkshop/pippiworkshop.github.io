               <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:0.85em;line-height: 1.2;"> Gentaro Taga is a Professor at Graduate School of Education, the University of Tokyo. He received the Ph. D. degree in pharmaceutical sciences (biophysics) from The University of Tokyo in 1994. He was a JSPS postdoctoral fellow at Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University and Neuro-Muscular Research Center, Boston University in 1994. He joined the complex system research group as an assistant professor at Department of Pure and Applied sciences, University of Tokyo in 1995. In 2000, he established Developmental Brain Science Laboratory at Graduate School of Education.
               <br>Prof. Taga has been studying the human early development as a complex dynamical system, and has conducted research aiming at elucidating the mechanisms of brain morphogenesis, emergence of spontaneous activity, network formation, functional region differentiation, behavioral and cognitive development in a changing environment. He is known by the dynamical systems modeling study of the neuro-musculo-skeletal system for human locomotion. He is also known as a pioneer of brain imaging of infants by using fNIRS. His group has established a novel fNIRS analysis framework to reveal spontaneous activity, functional activity, functional connectivity, oxygenation and hemodynamics of the developing brain. His laboratory has also conducted behavioral studies to elucidate the developmental mechanisms for motion, perception, sleep and language.

His research interests include the quantification of blood flow and myocardial function in children using MRI. Over the last 15 years, his research has focused on fetal cardiovascular physiology, including development of novel MRI acquisition and reconstruction approaches using highly undersampled data and iterative reconstructions with motion correction. These methods have enabled visualization of 3D fetal cardiovascular anatomy and hemodynamics, with the goal of improving our understanding of healthy fetal development and its disruption by diseases such as congenital heart disease and placental insufficiency.<br><br></b><br><br>

His research is focused on the design and development of specialized instruments and systems for fetal therapy, especially for fetal endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) procedures to treat fetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). He has developed a flexible robot-actuated fetoscope to simplify and reduce tissue damage in FETO procedures. Prior to joining KU Leuven he worked as a research engineer with Smith & Nephew, designing electrosurgical devices for minimally invasive surgeries. His ongoing work also includes the development of a tele-operated system for the control of fetoscope and ultrasound probe position, which will be used to investigate synergistic and autonomous robotic control strategies for fetal surgery.<br><br></b><br><br>

                             <br>Dr. Maria Deprez is a Senior Lecturer at King's College London. She leads research on motion correction and image analysis of fetal and neonatal MRI to enable diagnosis and biomarker extraction. Her techniques are underpinning numerous fetal research projects and fetal MRI clinical services at St Thomasâ€™ and Evelina Children Hospital London.  Dr Deprez has over 15 years of experience in advanced image analysis with focus on MRI during fetal, neonatal and early childhood periods. She completed her PhD in Medical Image Computing at Imperial College London in 2009. She worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College London, University of Oxford and Kingâ€™s College London, before taking up an academic position at Kingâ€™s. <br><br></b><br><br>

                              <br>Research Scientist Katholieke University Leuven and University Hospital Leuven, Belgium. Mirza Awais Ahmad is a research scientist working with the Robot-Assisted Surgery group at Katholieke University Leuven and the Fetal Medicine unit of University Hospital Leuven, Belgium. His research has been focused on the development of specialized instruments for fetal therapy, especially for fetoscopic laser coagulation (FLC) for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). He has worked on using machine learning to develop assistive technologies and a shared-control approach toward robotic instrumentation for fetal therapy. His work also includes the development of virtual reality training simulators for FLC and silicon-based surgical trainers for fetoscopic Spina Bifida repair (fSB repair). His research also investigates the effects of cannulation through multiple anatomical layers on the fetal membranes using finite element analysis.<br><br></b><br><br>

               <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:0.85em;line-height: 1.2;"> <br>Gentaro Taga is a Professor at Graduate School of Education, the University of Tokyo. He received the Ph. D. degree in pharmaceutical sciences (biophysics) from The University of Tokyo in 1994. He was a JSPS postdoctoral fellow at Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University and Neuro-Muscular Research Center, Boston University in 1994. He joined the complex system research group as an assistant professor at Department of Pure and Applied sciences, University of Tokyo in 1995. In 2000, he established Developmental Brain Science Laboratory at Graduate School of Education.
               <br>Prof. Taga has been studying the human early development as a complex dynamical system, and has conducted research aiming at elucidating the mechanisms of brain morphogenesis, emergence of spontaneous activity, network formation, functional region differentiation, behavioral and cognitive development in a changing environment. He is known by the dynamical systems modeling study of the neuro-musculo-skeletal system for human locomotion. He is also known as a pioneer of brain imaging of infants by using fNIRS. His group has established a novel fNIRS analysis framework to reveal spontaneous activity, functional activity, functional connectivity, oxygenation and hemodynamics of the developing brain. His laboratory has also conducted behavioral studies to elucidate the developmental mechanisms for motion, perception, sleep and language.
